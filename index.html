<h2>Trashboat</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect the trash in the water to save the dolphins.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel bad for the sea creatures with all the trash in the water.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Educational
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players control a boat and move through the ocean picking up trash to score points. If you hit a dolphin or a dolphin eats the trash you lose points. Use the arrow keys to control the boat.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Having fun on tilemaps.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A boat that animates through the tilemap of water, collision detection and a satisfying sound when you do good!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Today much of our trash ends up in the ocean killing and feeding sea animals.  Those that survive eating the trash are sometimes caught and eaten by us with plastic still in their bellies! Help clean up the oceans so the fish are safe again.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Indestructable plastic started flowing into the ocean after its creation in the 1940s. How long will it take to make the waters safe again?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is intended to spread awarness so is open to all audiences, but specifically focuses on the population between the ages 3 and 30.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game can be played for as long as the player wishes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Pick up the trash before the dolphins can get to them.  Avoid scaring the dolphins into moving so you can get the trash around them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I got my original spritesheets off of google and edited them in gimp to better fit my game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed help from the mario tilemap Phaser example.
